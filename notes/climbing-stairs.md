## üìã Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

```

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```

**Constraints:**

	‚Ä¢ `1 <= n <= 45`

-======================üí° Solution & Notes =====================-


```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1: // if there is one step, then there is only one way
            return 1
        first,second = 1, 2 

        for _ in range(3, n+1): // it is just like a fibonacci
            first,second = second, first+ second 
                            // starting at the 3rd step, there is 3 ways of getting there
                            // take 1 step, then a 2nd
                            // take two steps then one
                            // take 3 1 steps
                            //for a total of 3 ways

                            // Then moving to the 4th step, 
                            // you can take 4 1 steps : 1 way
                            // go: 1 -> 3 -> 4 for a second way
                            // go 2 -> 4 for a third way
                            // go 2 -> 3 -> 4 for a fourth way
                            // go 1 -> 2 -> 4 for a 5th way

        return second // second keeps track of both the ONE steps and the TWO steps
```
# Approach
Explain your solution approach here...

Essentially, we know that for step 1, there is one way, and for step 2 there are two ways.
So we set first = 1 (ways to climb 1 step) and second = 2 (ways to climb 2 steps).

Each time we move up a step, we update these two values.

Before each move:

**first** holds the number of ways to reach the step **two** below (i-2)

**second** holds the number of ways to reach the **previous** step (i-1)

When we climb to the next step (i):

We shift forward: first takes on the old second (it now represents i-1)

We recalculate second as the sum of the old first and old second, because:

ways(i) = ways(i-1) + ways(i-2)

==============================================================



There is 1 way to get to the first step.
There are 2 ways to get to the second step.

Starting at the third step:

first holds the number of ways to get to step 2 (the step two below the current one).

We then compute the new number of ways (second) as the sum of the ways to the two previous steps ‚Äî because any path to the current step must come from either one step down or two steps down.

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Key Insights
- fibonacci but a little tweaked
- dynamic programming, storing the data from previous
- this one was really fun to learn

## Alternative Solutions
idk
